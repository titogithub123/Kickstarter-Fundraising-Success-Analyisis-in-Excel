## *Analysis of Kickstarter Crowdfunding Success and Failuere rates 2009-2017 in Excel*
### Overview of Project
  This project intends to work with data from worldwide Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns in various catagories in an attempt to extract information that can provide valuabe insight in regards to the Success and Failure rates of distinct kickstarter projects. 
### Purpose
  The purpose of this anaysis is to use the vast amount of kickstarter crowdfunding campaign data available to us to help our dear friend, Louise determine the **Best** stratagey moving forward to help fund her play, ***Fever*** which she has worked so hard to bring to fruition. 
### Analsysis and Challenges
  Our analysis was completed by sorting through the vast sea of kickstarter data and honing in on only the most relevent pieces of information that would  answer the follwing questions in the **Theatre/Plays** catagory:
  ```
  What dollar amount would be best to strive for as a Kickstarter goal to ensure the highest probablilty of success meeting 
  that goal through pledged amounts?
  
  And, 
  
  What time of year and what month(s), specifically would be best to launch the campaign to ensure maximum success?  
  ```
The most challenging aspect was knowing how to take the sheer volume of raw kickstarter data (***see image below***) and converting it into useful knowledge that could intellegintly be analyzed and interpreted to make valid recomendations that would indeed help our friend, Louise to succesfully find funding for her play.
